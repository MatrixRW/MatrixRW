Hello, I’m MatrixRW (Yuri) </>
I started my Roblox development journey for 7 years ago. Starting out with solo-projects and learning in order to build myself up to more recent projects. 
I gathered crucial experience and knowledge along the way which I believe has shaped how I work on projects.

I’m a graduate computer science student at a British Grammar school also having studied physics and biology. I’ve found great interest in software engineering and games design which led me to Roblox. 
I started Roblox development from a young age, where I would work on small games that would never go anywhere but were fun to work on regardless. I continued this rinse and repeat process for ~6 years.

I’m a full stack developer, I can cover pretty much any base however my key focus has always been programming both inside and outside of Roblox. Having picked up Lua, Python, JavaScript and Lazarus along the way. 
I’m familiar with games design having worked in the field and through creating my own games developed a skill within UI design and 3D design. Though I’m still working on my skills in blender.

I’m a fast learner and maintain a good work ethic. I have been involved with vastly different communities and I like to think that I had a positive social reputation within them.
